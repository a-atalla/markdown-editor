This is a markdown editor.  There are many like it but this one is mine.  It has many features:

1. Editing markdown
2. Edit preview CSS
3. Preview markdown

It can even open and save files! That is about it.

***Warning: *** This was built as an exercise with Python, Qt, and PySide. **No input validation** is performed, leaving it open to all sorts of fun/risk. It might even be fun to just use this as an exercise on how to hack/break something.
